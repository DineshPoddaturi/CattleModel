<!-- 1. Japan lifted it's ban on the importation of US beef nearly 2 years after BSE in the US. -->
<!-- 2. December 2005, Japan agreed to remove the restriction on importing US beef. However, in January imports stopped again because inspectors found banned cattle parts in a veal shipment from the U.S. -->
<!-- 3. South Korea resumed U.S. beef imports in July 2008.  -->
<!-- 4. China lifted it's ban in 2016 -->


# Optimistic Scenario:\newline

Year1:  5% domestic demand decline and exports are banned \newline
Year2: Domestic demand is back up and exports are banned \newline
Year3: Everything goes back to pre FMD \newline


<!-- 1. 5% Decline in domestic demand for 1 year\newline -->
<!-- 2. In year 2 domestic demand goes back up\newline -->
<!-- 3. Exports banned for 2 years (I used exports in 2008 as the exports share for the simulation years)\newline -->
<!-- 4. In year 3 exports ban is lifted and everything is back to normal -->

# Pessimistic Scenario:\newline

Year1: 5% domestic demand decline and exports are banned \newline
Year2: 5% domestic demand decline and exports are banned \newline
Year3: 5% domestic demand decline and exports are banned \newline
Year4: Domestic demand goes back up, exports are still banned \newline
Year5: Exports are still banned \newline
Year6: Export band is lifted and everything goes back to pre FMD


<!-- 1. 5% Decline in domestic demand for 3 years\newline -->
