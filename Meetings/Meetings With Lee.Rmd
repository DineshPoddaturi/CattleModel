* Beef Demand is a function of prices and other stuff. Use the word beef disappearance. 
* Need to have micro details. Not just the NASS. NASS gets data from USDA reports. So we need to record the actual source of the data. 
* We have to know where exactly the data comes from. So make sure you find that. 
* Dressed weights and prices should have same units. Make sure the prices are matched with the weight i.e., are the prices for live weight or for dressed weights.
* The data needs to be transparant and crystal clear. Basically build a database (a loose word). 

* For Third year paper: Develop a regional model. The settings could change from the national model. Note that things would change for regional models. Think about this more clearly. 

* Drop by and knock the door if closed or just talk with them. Make sure to meet them very frequently i.e., once a week. Even if I don't make a major progress just let them know you are working and keeping at it. 

* He might be harsh on you but it's for the best. They are here to help you and make sure you get the best out of grad school. 

10/20/2020:

* I sent an email to Lee regarding research updates. Dropped by at his office. The door was closed.

11/05/2020:

* Gave him updates on what happened in my presentation. He said it's okay if people find it complicated. Report the comments you get to Lee and Chad. Do not bog down on the comments and try to work it out by yourself. 

* AAEA: Try to get a draft done and send them to Lee and Chad. Try to add Rational Exceptations and/or policy analysis in the existing model. And maybe the regional model as well. 

* For third year paper research proposal I can use the grant proposal. 



12/02/2020:

* Gave updates and how the prediction is going.

* Told me to remember that we need to show how our dynamic model works better than the static EDMs. Doesn't need to be the perfect or something that exacatly replicates the observed data. When looking at policy analysis we apply our model and compute the prices and the welfare for producer and consumer.

12/14/2020:

* Gave updates about the model and what I discussed with Chad.
* Told me not to bogdown by perfecting the model. Also asked me to look at the papers for policy analysis, which is tracebality. There are some papers on tracebality issues. We should then be able to compute the consumer and producer surplus. Since there are already some papers we can show our model does better than others and this can be used for policy analysis. 


02/24/2021:

* Gave brief updates about the modeling and results. He asked if we can somewhat replicate the other studies using our model. 
* Also is there any way to backout the elasticities from the model. If we can do that it would be helpful. 
* Asked me to keep tabs on writing and make sure do all that stuff. Intro and other sections. 
* Told me they got one year extension for the project. They can fund me one more year. So do not worry about the funding for one year.

03/04/2021:

* Said hello and told him about my concerns of presenting the solved model. He said, I might be overthinking. Show them whatever you have. Since it is ten minutes, show them the important elements. 

* Presenting comparitive statics could be difficult. We cannot keep everything else constant and take some first derivatives. For instance, if I change the fed cattle price, it should reflect in prices, costs, and quantities over the time. Keeping everything else same and changing one thing at a time is not gonna workout.

* Maybe show them how our model is different from the static EDM, and using our model is important for the Beef industry.


03/23/2021:

* Showed him the producer surplus loss with different adoption rate. He asked whether they are linear in the losses. If it's a mandatory program what adoption would give less losses.

* Also think about how can we compare and constrast the results. Is there anyway we could include elasticities in the model to get numerical measurement?

* Our current model is letting everything flow freely. If we include some form of elasticity, would it give measures that can be compared with other studies?

* Also make sure the results can be used for some policy advice.

04/07/2021:

* Told him about the AAEA acceptance for poster presentation. He said prepare the poster and send it to them. It's okay if it's a poster.
* Also told me if I wanna go, we can have monies from the grant. 
* Told me we should push the paper for some publications this summer. 


06/28/2021:

* Talked with Lee about the travel and accomodation for the annual meeting.
* He said he will send me the account number for travel. 
* I have to use my credit card for hotel booking and food. I can reimburse these along with registration fee after I get back from the meeting.
* Told him about the research progress. 
* He also talkd about how my dessertation should be looking like.
* Once the rational expectations model is done we have to focus on the regional model and one application. The application could be traceability or FMD.
* He said my third year paper meets the guidlines for independent author. 

08/24/2021:

* Talked about how the conference went. And how some of the audience gave suggestions to include weather variable in getting the price. He said he would send me the recent papers he saw from a student at Kstate.

* He also told me to get things moving so that we have at least a paper under review before the prelims. 
* I told him that I would like to do the prelims in Spring semester. I have to start writing the work as well. This takes a lot of time.



09/13/2021:

* Talked about what I discussed with chad and chads recommendations. 
* Lee told me to focus on writing as well. And told me not to wait until the end. He has a lot of students, and he needs to work on their papers as well.
* I NEED TO FOCUS ON WRITING A LOT.
