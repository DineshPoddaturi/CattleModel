Regarding the adjustment factor, instead of using a constant (in our case Median or Mean) use the previous year adjustment factor. When it comes to projecting into the future we use the entire factors to get a rough estimate. This is just another trial. Note that this is not our final trial. 

10/16/2020:
The estimates are consistently over estimating or under estimating. Move Fed Cattle Prices & Holding Costs and keep cull prices as constant and force the supply and disappearance of meat to be equal. 

10/27/2020:
Use the data of slaughtered animals to find the disappearance of meat and plot them, the supply we have and the disappearance from WASDE. By doing this we can get a better understanding of what to do next. 

11/06/2020:

* Try to see the prices by adjusting the supply. It should go up. Because the supply is going down rite now.

* Carry on without the adjustment factor and then estimate the prices and stuff.

12/14/2020:

* Showed the new estimates of prices and the meat. They are looking good. Also showed the demand prediction which are very noisy. 
* Plan is to use the predicted demand to estimate the future price. Use that price to estimate the future demand and loop around. Hopefully this will collapse the noise.
