Regarding the adjustment factor, instead of using a constant (in our case Median or Mean) use the previous year adjustment factor. When it comes to projecting into the future we use the entire factors to get a rough estimate. This is just another trial. Note that this is not our final trial.

The estimates are consistently over estimating or under estimating. Move Fed Cattle Prices & Holding Costs and keep cull prices as constant and force the supply and disappearance of meat to be equal.

Use the data of slaughtered animals to find the disappearance of meat and plot them, the supply we have and the disappearance from WASDE. By doing this we can get a better understanding of what to do next.

* Try to see the prices by adjusting the supply. It should go up. Because the supply is going down rite now.

* Carry on without the adjustment factor and then estimate the prices and stuff.
