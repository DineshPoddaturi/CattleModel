10/12/2020:
Regarding the adjustment factor, instead of using a constant (in our case Median or Mean) use the previous year adjustment factor. When it comes to projecting into the future we use the entire factors to get a rough estimate. This is just another trial. Note that this is not our final trial. 

10/16/2020:
The estimates are consistently over estimating or under estimating. Move Fed Cattle Prices & Holding Costs and keep cull prices as constant and force the supply and disappearance of meat to be equal. 

10/27/2020:
Use the data of slaughtered animals to find the disappearance of meat and plot them, the supply we have and the disappearance from WASDE. By doing this we can get a better understanding of what to do next. 

11/06/2020:

* Try to see the prices by adjusting the supply. It should go up. Because the supply is going down rite now.

* Carry on without the adjustment factor and then estimate the prices and stuff.

12/14/2020:

* Showed the new estimates of prices and the meat. They are looking good. Also showed the demand prediction which are very noisy. 
* Plan is to use the predicted demand to estimate the future price. Use that price to estimate the future demand and loop around. Hopefully this will collapse the noise. 


01/08/2021:

* Showed the plots that I did. Chad said these are projections, they look the way they are suposed to look and the model is doing it's job.
* However, inorder to estimate everything properly we need to adjust the parameters such that the model estimates the prices properly. To do that: i. we need to look at the estimated supply, demand and observed supply, demand. These need to be balanced through prices and parameters. ii. Note that the parameters $\mu$ and $s$ depend on the price, $sl,cl$ ratios (refer code for further details). Now once we have $\hat{sl}, \hat{cl}, \hat{A}$, compare them with $sl, cl, A$ and see whether they are same or not. We should expect some discrepencies. So use them to get new $\tilde{\mu},\tilde{s}$ and then use the newly computed parameters to estimate the prices. iii. Keep in mind that these parameters might need to be computed every year and at the end we might see some pattern of these parameters. For estimating future, we might take a value of these parameters or construct a formula for it. 
* This is good. We are getting somewhere. He said model building is difficult and once we build this it will get better. 
* For policy analysis: for instance take tracebility. If US imposes mandatory tracebality on all the beef products produced in the US, imports from foreign countries would increase which will result in high demand. By introducing this shock (we wouldn't know exactly how much the demand would increase by but we can use some number like 10% or 15%) we can see how the supply and prices would react. This policy would also increase the costs for producer so we would have to include them in the model as well. For instance the producer will add heifers to the breeding stock to get profits out of it but the costs associated with will go up. Hence a 10% or something like that increase in the hoolding costs. We might have to include them in the model to correctly estimate the prices and quantities. 


01/26/2021:

* Showed the estimates and the plots. He said these are promising.

* When it comes to introducing the shocks: First we introduce the cost shock. We do not know how the demands gonna look like. So we keep everything same and just introduce the cost shock. Here in our model those are holding costs. So basically we increase these holding costs by some percentage using the literature. Note that these are not fixed costs. These costs remain for every year. SSo these costs increments are for every year (keep that in mind).

* Now when it comes to comparing the projections with the shock: We compare it with the model estimates. We are not doing it with the observed data. The reason for this is: if the projection with the shock falls between the model estimate and the observed data, it would not be ideal for our narrative. So make sure we compare the projections with the model estimates. Adding to that, we are using the observed data to estimate until the shock and then using the model estimates to project the impacts of the shock. See the notes made in the fed cattle graph.

* Once we figure out the cost shock. We can introduce the demand shock to see how it goes. But for now we are sticking with the cost shock.

* Send him the cost increase estimates from previous studies.


02/01/2021:

* Showed the cost estimates from the studies. He said use the latest numbers. In our case it would be from SAV study. And use the tag and tagging costs. Do not include SAV costs. 

* We know the animal numbers in any year. So we can compute the costs. Again look at the fed cattle and cow numbers to compute the costs. And use those animals to get the cost per pound of meat. The costs are in dollars per head, if we know the animal type and number, we can get the cost per pound of meat.

* Every year the animal is alive, the costs add up. Like any other cost, we are incurring these costs every year. Just remember them.

* We don't have to include an exogenous supply shock like EDMs. Our model should be able to adjust the supply with the costs. This will get complicated. Make sure we include the costs carefully.



02/12/2021:

* Talked about the estimates and how the prices went up but by very little. He said we expect that. He is glad the model is reacting to our changes and it is not going bonkers or doing nothing. 

* The way I computed costs were fine. So don't bother about them. 

* Since the costs went up by like around 7 cents per pound, we saw some increase in prices (in cents again). It's okay if we don't see much change in the supply or demand (because all our computations are in pounds and are in aggregate level). To avoid any confusion, try to comute changes in percentages (prices, quantity, revenue, and costs). That will help with communicating properly.

* Also said in equilibrium the revenue and costs should cancel out or move towards zero.

02/19/2021:

* Showed the percent changes in the prices and quantities with the introductin of costs in the observed data.

* We need to plot the changes of observed, model estimate, and the estimate with the added costs. Include them in one graph. Until 2009, only observed then we need to see observed, model estimate and the estimate with added costs.

* Do not round any estimates. We need to see changes in price, quantities if we change any variable. We need to see changes that makes economic sense and has economic intuition. 

* I guess, try to do the above point by introducing costs in the model estimate as well. He didn't asked for it, but might come in handy.

* Always remember numbers are always wrong. Do not worry much about the magnitude of the numbers. We need to worry more about the direction than the magnitude. Always keep this in mind.


02/25/2021:

* Showed him the graphs and the numbers. Seeing zero change in slaughter quantities is troublesome. 
* The fed cattle meat increment using the model estimates is huge and need to investigate that properly. Although the price changes are very little in both cases, we see the fed cattle meat change in the later (using the model estimates). That's not ideal. 

* 09: Actual Holding costs  + Tagging Costs
  10: Model Holding Costs + Tagging Costs
  11: ditto.....
  
* I think we change only the prices and costs. Try to keep the quantities as observed. That might change the results. 
* We need to see changes consistently. Also round the numerics to 3 to 4 digits. We are not giving precise estimates, so rounding is alright. 


03/04/2021:

* Showed the plots of the fed cattle prices and quantities. They don't make sense at all. Prices went up, we would expect the quantities to go down to meet the demand.
* This is similar to the cull cows as well. 
* I did not adjust for the demand and supply. Since we did not adjust for demand, the supply is assuming the higher demand needs to meet, so the supply is jumping up. We have to adjust in order to meet the demand and the estimated prices. 
* We will see changes once we adjust for the demand.


03/15/2021:

* Showed the results from the simulations. He said the simulations from using the model estimates and using the data look promising. 
* Told me to use the results of simulation using observed data to put it in the paper. We can use the results of simulation from the model estimates for a different paper.
* Asked me to go ahead and project the future prices and quantities for 10 years. If they flatten out after some years that means we are doing it rite. If they are going up and down that means we are in trouble.

03/25/2021:

* Showed him the surplus with different adoption rates and how they are linear. Asked him how can we compare them with the past studies because the magnitude is not same.

* The answer is: the models are different, the cost structure we included are different. We used only Variable Cost (tag and tagging costs per head). Now if we remove the variable cost the surplus would be zero. The past studies also included the Fixed Costs (say database or other technological costs). Again our model is mimicking the past studies which confirms that the model can be used for further analysis. 

* It's actually good that the numbers are different. We expect those numbers to be different. If we add the other things like in the past studies, with a simple accounting exercise we can get the same results.

* About elasticities: Our main parameter $\tilde{\mu}$ is capturing the elasticity. That parameter is mean/median WTP for fed cattle meat over cull cow meat so that should say something about the elasticity. Without that parameter we cannot proceed with anything.



04/01/2021:

* Showed him the changes with increase in demand. Rite now, the supply of the slaughter cattle is going way down and the cull cows is going up. This is trouble some. With the traceability, if the demand is increasing, the supply of the slaughter cattle/high quality meat should go up but we see the lower quality meat going up. Probably we have to pay close attention to the share metric and see how this is changing the share of the slaughter and cull cattle.

* When it comes to the short-run and long-run estimations, we see immediate change in the short-run i.e., 2010. That's good. And the supply and prices remained same meaning the pathway of them looks same as the model estimate. This implies the prices are adjusting in the long run. The impacts are consistent making them rite. Now, if we adjust the model estimate with the change in the new estimate, we should be able to see almost no change in the long run. Maybe I should try doing that and see.

* Rite now the changes we see in the slaughter cattle are consisntent both theoritically and intuitively. However, the changes we see in the cull cattle are can be considered a weakness. The changes we see could be explained in the following way: the producers might be culling the older/under-performing cows from the breeding stock making the supply to go up. Or we could say that with the decrease in supply of the fed cattle, in order to meet the demand the cull cows supply should go up. Our model is doing that. We could call the cull cows as the residual. Since the majority of the market share is from the slaughter cattle, cull cows share is less. Think more about how you can explain this.

* Our model differs from the other models especially with the parameters. Instead of fixing the parameters to a single value, we made it flexible so it can move with the changes we observe in the data. This is a good feature.



07/02/2021:

* Showed him how I am estimating the prices (by making the difference between old coefficients and new coefficients to a pre determined tolerance level). The prices are becoming stagnent after going through two/three nodes. We should be able to go through all the nodes without becoming constant immediately. Chad thinks the program might be finding a local min/max and isn't moving/jumping to next value. 

* The suggestion Chad gave: instead of checking the tolerance level between the coefficients try checking them for supply and demand. If somehow this works we are out of the woods. But be careful when making these kind of changes. We should be able to explain things why we made that decision.

* Gaussian quadrature for integration is another complicated work. We should be careful when it comes to that. I (dinesh) believe that with gaussian quadrature for integration we should be able to get the expected price properly. 

* Note: Expected price and actual price are not same and shouldn't be same. So remember that. 

07/28/2021:

* Told him about how I am setting bounds for the price and how the price is bouncing back and forth.
* Chads comments: Check for how often are we hitting bounds. 10-15% is okay but if it's more than that then increase the bounds and see the changes.

* For getting the starting price: we could use the last periods price. But make sure that regardless of the starting price, the model should converge pretty much the same price. Keep that in mind.

* Watch out for : 1. Does the prices, quantities get stuck? Does the model bounce back and forth? If that's the case then we need to think about the model carefully. 

* When it comes to the additional expression we have (this expression includes expected value of the three year old cow). Look at the final expression. 
$$\beta^7 E p_{c,t+7} + g sum^{9}_{i = 4} \beta^i p_{s,t+i} == B = p_{s,t} - g beta^3 E p_{s,t+3} + sum^{6}_{i = 0} beta^i z_{t+i}$$
Here we know the RHS. compute that first and you basically know the RHS. So use this in the system of equations.



08/24/2021:

* Told him about how the prices are jumping off and hitting the boundaries. But they are not stabilizing. He suggested 
 me to plot the prices for every node and see how it looks like. If we find some outliers and there's not a lot observed  until the middle, we might wanna chop some off and take the values.
 
* Including the drought variable could increase the precision of the price estimation. 

* Chad told me to use chebyshev weights to get the expectation of the price. Usually there isn't much difference between hermite and chebyshev weights. Since we are using the chebyshev nodes and chebyshev polynomials using chebyshev weights could be optimal.

09/13/2021:

* Showed him some results and told him how the first 3/4th of the prices are captured and 1/4 are not captured when the interval is small. Also told him if the interval is large we see the opposite phenomena. 

* Chad told me my construction of future production is proper. Since everything depends on the current period or the past period, and shocks. It follows the competitive storage type model framework, so that's good. 

* Also told him if the price of the cull cows are captured properly, the price of the fed cattle is over estimated. However, if the price of the fed cattle is captured properly, the price of the cull cows is underestimated. He said this is strange: Since the constructed production for fed cattle is more than the observed one, we should see the lower prices. I need to look into it again. 

* He told me to squeeze the price window to capture the history very well and see how much of the error for the later years. Now, if we see the model is consistently underestimating with some percentage, we can adjust for it. However, we need to have a rational for it. This can be done by checking the structural breaks, if we find a structural break and if the prices are acting weird after that structural break, we can use that break to introduce the adjustment. 


* Also told me about the policy recommendations we can give from the model. If we want a larger supply of beef (quality beef) or more productive breeding stock, a policy that makes the farmers to cull the older cows can work. Since that would decrease the supply of fed cattle this period and increase the supply of cull cows. If we want the other way around i.e., more beef supply now, a policy (like price control on the cull cows) can help with that. 


10/07/2021:

* Showed him the things and also talked about how the supply and demand are not matching up. 

* Chads suggestions: 
    ** See the difference between the supply and demand. By looking at the difference we make the adjustments for the price. 
    ** Also see the historical difference between the supply and demand. Use that variation to build in the model. Remember, supply and demand don't exactly matches up. There's always some difference. This is how things work. 
    
    ** Look at the supply and demand relationship. 
          *** if the difference S-D>0 then price should go down.
          *** if the difference S-D<0 then price should go up.
              **** Within each condition we should also check the difference of fed cattle and cull cows. 
                  * Sf-Df>0 then Pf go down;Sc-Dc>0 then Pc go down.
                  * Sf-Df<0 then Pf go up;Sc-Dc<0 then Pc go up.

10/15/2021:

* Showed him the algorithm and also the process of it.
* Right now I am adjusting only the supply. Chad suggested, we need to adjust the corresponding demand as well.
* The density functions for the prices look like they are supposed to look like (Chads comments). We can pick mean or median and possibly provide confidence intervals as well. 

** So basically: once we get the price, and the supply and demand difference, using that we increase or decrease the price, get the price, then supply (using the other function I wrote to get the quntities of the cattle), use them to get the new prices, using those prices get the demand and repeat this process until the differences converge to a pre determined level. 

P -> S,D -> P -> S -> P -> D -> P -> S -> D so on....

* Also look at the supply pattern as well. Mainly the density/distribution of the supply. This should be mirror image of prices. 

** Right now the density of the prices are looking fairly okay. As we move along the years we see the hump at the higher end of the price decrease. This indicates there is a trend going on.

** Now, the cull cow prices are very sporadic with a lot of noise. This is expected. We don't see that in the fed cattle price (I guess that's a good sign). Note that in an instance of increased demand for beef, farmers have to wait to sell the high quality meat (because the young steers/heifers are in the pipeline or will take 2 years to get the cattle to packing plant). So the farmers send the old animals to the slaughter house. That's why we see a lot of noise in the price.


10/26/2021:

* Showed him the results and also the distribution of the prices. Also told him I see the prices are replicating for every 25 nodes. this is because the corn price is not utilized in the system of equations at all. So basically we have only 25 unique nodes (which are combination of the production and the demand shocks)

* Also told him about how the coefficients are not converging. Note that the prices are settling down at the equiibrium. However, the coefficients are not settling down. He told me to look for coefficients as well. 

* So basically: once the price reach the equilibrium keep them in seperate dataframe/matrix. Get the iteration moving and save the parameters and the prices in a different dataframe/matrix. This way we can see how the parameters are bahaving. We should also see the range of the parameters after running for a long time. This will tell us how to use the parameters/prices for future projections.


* Right now use the mean and median statistics to compare with the historical data. Plot the history and the model estimates. Do it for prices and quantities. 

11/8/2021:

* Showed him the results of the model. Equilibrium prices, quantities as well as the converged prices and quantities. If we are using time $t$ price to project three periods ahead, then the prices are showing the same pattern. However, if we use the same periods best information, the model fits properly. 

* I guess for projections, we use the model parameters, the estimated price to determine the future supply,  and the adjustment factor to estimate the derived demand. So by using the future supply, the derived demand, estimated price, fixed parameters, we get new price for that period. Do this process to project further ahead. 

* See the scratch work for more details. I will do more detailed version of the scratch work soon. 



11/22/2021:

* Talked with Chad about the projections and how they are odd looking. Especially lower bounds of the fed cattle prices. I was told to investigate that closely. 

* when I told Chad about the assumption of the relationship between $k_{3,t}$ and $k_{3,t+1}$ as $k_{3,t+1} = \gamma k_{3,t} + \epsilon$. He said it's extremely simplified assumption and I agree with him. Instead Chad suggested me to use calf-crop data. Basically calf-crop is $k_0$, new born babies. 

Once they get older, Calf-crop are futher categorized into Replacement Heifers, Slaughter, and some die with natural causes. 
So we build a relationship between the calf-crop and replacement heifers. 

$k_{3,t+1} = \gamma k_{3,t} + \eta k_{0,t-3} + \epsilon$

By fitting this relationship with data, we get the coefficients and then we can use the coefficients to further solve for $k_{3,t+1}$ in the model. Simply fit a simple OLS for this. I know prices will have to come into play but for now this is what we do. 


12/08/2021:

* Showed the projections, upper and lower bounds of the projections. I said I am fixing the $k_0$s for the data that are not available. Chad said, use the estimated/projected $k_3$s to get the $k_0$s. We know the total stock in any year. 
    at $t$, we have $K$, $k_0$s, we estimate $k_3$. Now at $t+1$, $k_3$s become $k_4$s and $k_0$s become $k_1$ and so on. So using this infomation, and using the birthrate we can always get the $k_0$s at any time. 

* I said about how I put a floor to the lower bounds. Note that since the stock are low the number of animals sent to slaughter house is also low. This is true for cull cows. So by following the historical data I set a floor to cull cows production to 1.01 billion pounds and for fed cattle a 20.01 billion pounds. Basically I am assuming in case of low production, we import enough animals/meat to match the demand for that specific meat. I am also increasing the production in increments of 10 million pounds instead of 1 billion directly. 

Chad asked me to further decrease the floor of the fed cattle production. Right now it is sitting at 20.01 which was observed recently in the data. So maybe change it to 19 billion and see the changes in the price. 

* I told him about the linear model I fitted to get the coefficients for the cull cow supply equation. I fitted the linear model without intercept. My rational for this is if the independent variables are zero then the dependent variable is zero as well i.e., if x is zero then y is zero in the model y = xb. Chad said it's okay to have no intercept in the linear model and the rational makes sense. 

* Regarding the abstract for the paper:

Look into the past research for what happens when FMD hits. Specifically what parameters we should be effected because of the disease.  

My ideas were: 1. death rate will be effected for sure i.e., the stock will be reduced for that year. 2. Export markets will close their borders. Hence there will be more meat left in the country. 3. The literature also says consumers preferences to consume meat will change as they associate disease with human health (even though FMD is not a threat to human). So the demand for the meat might decrease which will increase the price. However, since the exports are stopped there is more meat left, so this might impact the prices as well. 4. In an even of the vaccination there will be costs for the vaccination. In the absence of the government help this might increase costs for the producers.

We can change these parameters in the model and see how the impacts would look like. We need to be vary about the disease it self. This is treatable disease.

Chads' suggestions: Look into recent previous disease outbreaks in the United States. Specifically BSE in 2003. See the impacts of the disease. Like, how the demand, death rate, exports and such. We can use them either as a benchmark or literally take them as given in the model.

UK had FMD recently, so look at the impacts of FMD on UK market and borrow some of their quantities. 

Currently I am reading the Red book of USDA for immediate action that needs to be taken if there is a disease outbreak tomorrow. 
Chad told me to read Secure Beef Plan. This is a government plan about their steps in case of disease outbreak. 

When I asked him about the model vs disease, Chad and Lee both told me to highlight the disease outbreak. This is about the disease and simulating different scenarios and different scenario work. 


02/04/2022:

* Showed him the projections of the model. He said they are looking as they are supposed to look like. 
* Also asked me to reach out to FAPRI people to get their stochastic outcomes. All of their projections are averages across 500 stochastic outcomes. So if we have those we can see how well our model is projecting. 
* Asked him about the ARIMA model for the total breeding stock. Also told him this linear model is consistent with Cattle Cycles paper. But our linear model has additional MA terms. He said, that's okay. 

** Regarding FMD paper:

* Chad suggested if I am simulating the depopulation rates (20% to 90%), I don't have to consider the mortality rates of the adult cows and young cattle (depopulation already includes the mortality rates). 

* When it comes to the demand side, we must include the domestic and exports together. Since we don't have those demands seperately, we are including them together. 
  ** For export demand decline use the current share of exports (look for numbers). Mostly we will get the animal numbers in head. So we convert them to meat in pounds. 
  ** For domestic demand decline we rely on the literature. 
  
  ** So in our simulation, we add the export ban and domestic decline as the changes in the total demand for beef.
  ** We also include the number of years it will take for the demand to bounce back. 
  ** In an optimistic case we assume all the exports bounce back and the domestic demand also bounce back
  ** In a pessimistic case, exports do not bounce back.
  ** Under these scenarios, we simulate the model to see the changes.



02/24/2022:

Showed him the scenario results I have.

* 90% depop and 20% depop look fine but somehow 50% depop is looking wonky at the tail years. Especially, in the optimistic scenario. This needs to be investigated closely. 

* There's also another problem. When we look at the 20% and 50% depop stocks levels. 20% depop stock level is higher than the 50% depop stock level. So the prices must be in the opposite direction. However, the model is showing the other way around. Need to investigate that closely. 

* One idea I have is to add the excess fed cattle and cull cow animals as imports to the stock. For now the replacement heifers are added to the stock. So I believe I should also add the cull cows that are imported to reach the subsistence level of demand to the stock. But if we are already slaughtering the imported cull cows to reach the subsistence levels there is no need to add them in the stock. Need to think about this more. 

* In the plotting, instead of plotting the observed prices, plot the model estimates of the prices. 




03/10/2022:

* Showed chad the new simulation results. Hw commented about the stock levels.
* They never reach the baseline levels after the disease outbreak. They must reach the baseline or at least have a upward trend to reach the baseline.

* The model is saying we will never reach the baseline stocks. This should be corrected. Maybe this is driving the prices wonky.
* Remember we use p_{t-1} to get S_t and D_t by importing animals to reach the subsistence levels of demand. Now I need to check if (imports_t - imports_{t-1})>0 then the expected price should go up. This should be making farmers to increase the stock levels. 
I have to built that in the algorithm.
* We are also assuming the costs are not increaseing for importing. But we have costs in the model. 


03/24/2022:

* Showed Chad the new results and how the stocks are adding up. 
* The fed cattle prices and cull cow prices are not going crazy so that's good. However, the prices are way too low. And they are not reaching the baseline even in the long-run. 
* This is due to the fact that I am putting demand constant and changing the supply of the meat. I must change the demand as well.
* Use the prices to get the demand. Specifically, $D_{fed} = A_{t-1}exp(.)/1+exp(.)$ and $D_{cull} = A_{t-1} 1/1+exp(.)$.
* Use $D_{fed} + D_{cull}$ as the total derived demand ion the model. The shocks must include demand. They are demand driven. 

* Also try putting some weights for prices. Use historical prices to determine the weights. If you put weights to the prices, state it as as assumption.
