Regarding the adjustment factor, instead of using a constant (in our case Median or Mean) use the previous year adjustment factor. When it comes to projecting into the future we use the entire factors to get a rough estimate. This is just another trial. Note that this is not our final trial. 

10/16/2020:
The estimates are consistently over estimating or under estimating. Move Fed Cattle Prices & Holding Costs and keep cull prices as constant and force the supply and disappearance of meat to be equal. 

10/27/2020:
Use the data of slaughtered animals to find the disappearance of meat and plot them, the supply we have and the disappearance from WASDE. By doing this we can get a better understanding of what to do next. 

11/06/2020:

* Try to see the prices by adjusting the supply. It should go up. Because the supply is going down rite now.

* Carry on without the adjustment factor and then estimate the prices and stuff.

12/14/2020:

* Showed the new estimates of prices and the meat. They are looking good. Also showed the demand prediction which are very noisy. 
* Plan is to use the predicted demand to estimate the future price. Use that price to estimate the future demand and loop around. Hopefully this will collapse the noise. 


01/08/2021:

* Showed the plots that I did. Chad said these are projections, they look the way they are suposed to look and the model is doing it's job.
* However, inorder to estimate everything properly we need to adjust the parameters such that the model estimates the prices properly. To do that: i. we need to look at the estimated supply, demand and observed supply, demand. These need to be balanced through prices and parameters. ii. Note that the parameters $\mu$ and $s$ depend on the price, $sl,cl$ ratios (refer code for further details). Now once we have $\hat{sl}, \hat{cl}, \hat{A}$, compare them with $sl, cl, A$ and see whether they are same or not. We should expect some discrepencies. So use them to get new $\tilde{\mu},\tilde{s}$ and then use the newly computed parameters to estimate the prices. iii. Keep in mind that these parameters might need to be computed every year and at the end we might see some pattern of these parameters. For estimating future, we might take a value of these parameters or construct a formula for it. 
* This is good. We are getting somewhere. He said model building is difficult and once we build this it will get better. 
* For policy analysis: for instance take tracebility. If US imposes mandatory tracebality on all the beef products produced in the US, imports from foreign countries would increase which will result in high demand. By introducing this shock (we wouldn't know exactly how much the demand would increase by but we can use some number like 10% or 15%) we can see how the supply and prices would react. This policy would also increase the costs for producer so we would have to include them in the model as well. For instance the producer will add heifers to the breeding stock to get profits out of it but the costs associated with will go up. Hence a 10% or something like that increase in the hoolding costs. We might have to include them in the model to correctly estimate the prices and quantities. 


01/26/2021:

* Showed the estimates and the plots. He said these are promising.

* When it comes to introducing the shocks: First we introduce the cost shock. We do not know how the demands gonna look like. So we keep everything same and just introduce the cost shock. Here in our model those are holding costs. So basically we increase these holding costs by some percentage using the literature. Note that these are not fixed costs. These costs remain for every year. SSo these costs increments are for every year (keep that in mind).

* Now when it comes to comparing the projections with the shock: We compare it with the model estimates. We are not doing it with the observed data. The reason for this is: if the projection with the shock falls between the model estimate and the observed data, it would not be ideal for our narrative. So make sure we compare the projections with the model estimates. Adding to that, we are using the observed data to estimate until the shock and then using the model estimates to project the impacts of the shock. See the notes made in the fed cattle graph.

* Once we figure out the cost shock. We can introduce the demand shock to see how it goes. But for now we are sticking with the cost shock.

* Send him the cost increase estimates from previous studies.


02/01/2021:

* Showed the cost estimates from the studies. He said use the latest numbers. In our case it would be from SAV study. And use the tag and tagging costs. Do not include SAV costs. 

* We know the animal numbers in any year. So we can compute the costs. Again look at the fed cattle and cow numbers to compute the costs. And use those animals to get the cost per pound of meat. The costs are in dollars per head, if we know the animal type and number, we can get the cost per pound of meat.

* Every year the animal is alive, the costs add up. Like any other cost, we are incurring these costs every year. Just remember them.

* We don't have to include an exogenous supply shock like EDMs. Our model should be able to adjust the supply with the costs. This will get complicated. Make sure we include the costs carefully.



02/12/2021:

* Talked about the estimates and how the prices went up but by very little. He said we expect that. He is glad the model is reacting to our changes and it is not going bonkers or doing nothing. 

* The way I computed costs were fine. So don't bother about them. 

* Since the costs went up by like around 7 cents per pound, we saw some increase in prices (in cents again). It's okay if we don't see much change in the supply or demand (because all our computations are in pounds and are in aggregate level). To avoid any confusion, try to comute changes in percentages (prices, quantity, revenue, and costs). That will help with communicating properly.

* Also said in equilibrium the revenue and costs should cancel out or move towards zero.

02/19/2021:

* Showed the percent changes in the prices and quantities with the introductin of costs in the observed data.

* We need to plot the changes of observed, model estimate, and the estimate with the added costs. Include them in one graph. Until 2009, only observed then we need to see observed, model estimate and the estimate with added costs.

* Do not round any estimates. We need to see changes in price, quantities if we change any variable. We need to see changes that makes economic sense and has economic intuition. 

* I guess, try to do the above point by introducing costs in the model estimate as well. He didn't asked for it, but might come in handy.

* Always remember numbers are always wrong. Do not worry much about the magnitude of the numbers. We need to worry more about the direction than the magnitude. Always keep this in mind.


02/25/2021:

* Showed him the graphs and the numbers. Seeing zero change in slaughter quantities is troublesome. 
* The fed cattle meat increment using the model estimates is huge and need to investigate that properly. Although the price changes are very little in both cases, we see the fed cattle meat change in the later (using the model estimates). That's not ideal. 

* 09: Actual Holding costs  + Tagging Costs
  10: Model Holding Costs + Tagging Costs
  11: ditto.....
  
* I think we change only the prices and costs. Try to keep the quantities as observed. That might change the results. 
* We need to see changes consistently. Also round the numerics to 3 to 4 digits. We are not giving precise estimates, so rounding is alright. 


03/04/2021:

* Showed the plots of the fed cattle prices and quantities. They don't make sense at all. Prices went up, we would expect the quantities to go down to meet the demand.
* This is similar to the cull cows as well. 
* I did not adjust for the demand and supply. Since we did not adjust for demand, the supply is assuming the higher demand needs to meet, so the supply is jumping up. We have to adjust in order to meet the demand and the estimated prices. 
* We will see changes once we adjust for the demand.
