# Changes with observed prices and quantities

I estimate the price and quantities with the additional costs to the observed data. These are compared with the model estimates and the observed data. I compute the percentage changes in the price and quantity for fed cattle, cull cows as well as the aggregate producer surplus. The results are as follows:

Percentage change in price of fed cattle:
> percentChange_price_ps
  Year percentChange_ps_obs percentChange_ps_model
1 2010           -6.5766982              1.6306733

4 2013            0.7641544              1.1590637
5 2014          -16.0369276              1.1186796

7 2016           26.6988327              0.9035895

Percentage change in quantity of fed cattle:

1 2010            0.5114821          -1.617407e-14

7 2016            1.2584954           1.734328e-14

Here we have percentage change from the observed data and model respectively. The fed cattle price fell compared to observed, this is reflected in the quantities. The quantities went up by a little. The fed cattle prices went up compared to the model estimates. However, the quantities changed very little. Note that the price went by a little so we expect the same change in the quantities. 



Percentage change in price of cull cows:
> percentChange_price_pc
  Year percentChange_pc_obs percentChange_pc_model
1 2010           -22.305687               3.535708

4 2013            -1.322547               1.829043
5 2014           -23.717126               1.767165
6 2015             1.929532               1.353151
7 2016            37.000319               1.363775

Percentage change in quantity of cull cows:
> percentChange_cl
  Year percentChange_cl_obs percentChange_cl_model
1 2010           -0.5767056           1.130325e-05
2 2011            9.1561672           8.016228e-06
3 2012            8.1515734           1.013729e-05
4 2013           -8.3312239           1.063030e-05
5 2014           14.6568011          -1.535018e-05
6 2015           12.9117106           1.151384e-05
7 2016           11.5011345           9.786865e-06

Although prices fell for cull cows (compared to observed prices), the quantities remained almost same. However the prices went up when compared to the model estimates and the quantities remained same or fell by a little. 


Just note that cattle cycles play important role too. The observed data (especially stocks), follows the expansion and contraction of the stocks so our model does the same.

Aggregate producer surplus:
> revDiff_costs_t_pSurp
  Year diffRevCost_t_obs diffRevCost_t_model
1 2010        -2.1681188          -0.1577323
2 2011        -4.4930972          -0.1707075
3 2012        -2.1005092          -0.1675756
4 2013        -0.4705478          -0.1437623
5 2014        -6.9141243          -0.1545304
6 2015         1.8134526          -0.1474051
7 2016         7.5518716          -0.1561541

The aggregate producer surplus is negative for the first 5 years and then positive when we compare it to the observed data. However it is negative all the way when compared to the model.


# Changes with observed prices and quantities until 2009 and then model estimates from 2010

I estimate the price and quantities with the additional costs to the model estimates. These are compared with the model estimates and the observed data. I compute the percentage changes in the price and quantity for fed cattle, cull cows as well as the aggregate producer surplus. The results are as follows:
