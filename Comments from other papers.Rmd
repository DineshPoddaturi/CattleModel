* Evolving beef export market access requirements for age and source verification: This paper uses costs for different sectors within the beef industry. Cow/calf, Dairy, Backgrounding and feedlot, and packer.
COW/CALF: The costs per operation range from $\$185$ ($\$14.51$/head sold) for cow/calf operations having less than 50 head to $\$29,012$ ($\$5.39$/head sold) for operations with more than 5000 head.
DAIRY: Costs per operation range from about $\$190$ for operations with less than 50 head to $\$9900$ for operations with more than 2000 head.
BACKGROUNDING and FEEDLOT: Annual costs range from an average of slightly less than $\$800$ per operation for feedlots with less than 1000 head to an annual average of over $\$13,000$ for feedlots with more than 32,000 head. The estimated costs per operation for backgrounding operations â€“ range from $\$709$ for approximately 30 head to $\$1137$ for approximately 3000 head operations.
PACKING PLANT: Cost increases associated with ASV for steer and heifer slaughter plants ranged from a low of $\$0.16$/head for plants slaughtering 1.3 million head to a high of $\$0.47$/head for plants slaughtering 300 head per year.

These five group subtotals are summed to obtain the total cost for the cattle industry of adopting ASV. Costs associated with several sectors within the beef industry are aggregated for use in the economic model. For example, dairy, background, and feedlot costs are aggregated into the slaughter cattle sector while packer costs are referred to as wholesale costs.



* ANIMAL IDENTIFICATION AND TRACING IN THE UNITED STATES: This paper uses the cost estimates for all the meat sectors from the report Blasi et.al.2009. Similar to the above study, they use cost estimates for different segments within the industry. Specifically, Cow/Calf, Dairy, Background and feedlot, packer, and dairy. These costs are estimated according to the size of the operation. (We have to note that in our model we just look at the cost per pound of beef.)

COW/CALF: 
Operation that Currently Tags Cattle - Annual cost range from $\$5.95$/head (operation with less than 50 head) to $\$2.88$/head (operation with more than 5000 head)
Operation that Currently not tagging cattle - Annual cost range from $\$7.17$/head (<50 head) to $\$5.44$/head (>5000 head)

DAIRY: 
Operation that Currently Tags Cattle - Annual cost range from $\$5.84$/head (operation with less than 50 head) to $\$2.53$/head (operation with more than 5000 head)
Operation that Currently not tagging cattle - Annual cost range from $\$5.28$/head (<50 head) to $\$2.97$/head (>5000 head)

BACKGROUND: 
$\$1.70$/head (31 head) to $\$0.56$/head (2963 head)

FEEDLOT:
$\$1.37$/head (<1000 head) to $\$0.30$/head (>50000)

AUCTION MARKETS:
$\$0.145$ per head and a data storage cost of $\$0.085$ per head totaling $\$0.23$ per head

PACKERS:
steer and heifer: Volume weighted average = $0.15
cow and bull: Volume weighted average = $0.29
calf: Volume weighted average = $0.36

Summary of Cattle Industry Costs Under Scenario #3 (full traceability)
Beef Cow/Calf - $\$4.22$, Dairy- $\$3.43$, Background- $\$0.70$, Feedlot- $\$0.50$, Auction Yards- $\$0.23$, Packers- $\$0.10$
Industry Total - $\$2.07$.
